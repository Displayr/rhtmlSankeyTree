> Sankey Diagrams as Collapsible Trees

Combining Sankey diagrams with collapsible trees and adding some new interactivity might help us analyze, instruct, and decide.

## Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("NumbersInternational/rhtmlSankeyTree")
```

## Usage

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(rpart)
library(partykit)
library(pipeR)
library(rhtmlSankeyTree)

#set up a little rpart as an example
rp <- rpart(
  hp ~ cyl + disp + mpg + drat + wt + qsec + vs + am + gear + carb,
  method = "anova",
  data = mtcars,
  control = rpart.control(minsplit = 4)
)

#convert rpart to a hierarchy using convert_rpart in converters.R
# this was the original conversion
# and I already see lots of room for improvement
rhtmlSankeyTree:::convert_rpart(rp)

#see what it looks like
SankeyTree(rp)

SankeyTree(rp, maxLabelLength = 10, nodeHeight = 100)



# do with kyphosis example
SankeyTree(
  rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, data = kyphosis),
  maxLabelLength = 10,
  nodeHeight = 200
)

```
